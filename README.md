# README

This is being built as a part of a project for the Ruby on Rails 5 course, which is available on www.OneMonth.com

Things you may want to know:

* This was built using Rails 5.0.0.1, and Ruby 2.3.0p0

* Once you've downloaded and installed everything, you can navigate to the main folder containing the site, and run it using the command line command: rails server.

* This is an ongoing project and won't be finished until after November 11, 2016. Anything before that date is likely going to be incomplete.

* This is an extra line of text for no good reason at all.

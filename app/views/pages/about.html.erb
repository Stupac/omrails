            <p>Hey, I'm Stewart White. I live in Oregon, and have an awesome wife, two wonderful daughters, and a boy on the way.
            I like to challenge myself to keep learning. This website is one of those ways that I've continued to do so. I created this as part of the Ruby on Rails course through www.onemonth.com. </p>
